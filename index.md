### 🙏🏾 Keep me in prayer
* That I continue to dedicate and prioritize time to prepare, regardless of my other commitments.  
* For my trust to be in God and not myself as I evangelize, especially in these unique circumstances.  
* To not confuse serving with my relationship with God -- may serving not become a crutch!  

### 🤝🏾 Donations for our team and myself
* Online @ [missions.tisuela.com/support/](https://missions.tisuela.com/support/)   
* Mail cash or checks to Church of Southland **(Attn: Nathaniel Louis Tisuela) - 1380 S. Sanderson Ave. Ste 201 Anaheim, CA 92806**
