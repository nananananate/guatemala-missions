### 🙏🏾 Keep me in prayer
* That I continue to dedicate and prioritize time to prepare, regardless of my other commitments.  
* For my trust to be in God and not myself as I evangelize, especially in these unique circumstances.  
* To not confuse serving with my relationship with God -- may serving not become a crutch!
