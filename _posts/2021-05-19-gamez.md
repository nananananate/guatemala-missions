I've been assigned to lead games with a team of other Southland college students -- Harrisen and Elizabeth -- as we do Vacation Bible School (VBS) in Cobán, Guatemala. We're actually doing two VBSes (is that the plural? Or is it VBees? VBSi?), one for an Acts Ministries International (AMI) church, and another for the AMI International School. 

Although I've been "assigned" to this team, I don't see it as by chance.

## 🤪 I be playin games

For the past sixteen years, I've been playing games at church. I'm thinking of going Pro (pls sponsor me). Awana was a constant in my life since I was seven and I served there from middle school until I left Sacramento for college. My summers were the same story, but instead of Awana games I participated and led VBS games in the Sacramento heat. 

Even in college, organized games in Christian ministries are still somewhat of a constant -- for some reason every college Christian fellowship had their own Beach Olympics. I'm not complaining though. These activities served an important part for me to grow closer to spiritual community and invite friends to join me. 

I think that's why you always see games as a part of children's Christian ministry. It's how you get to them, how they get to you, and how they grow closer to each other. I've been blessed to see this happen in Awana as I've grown. These kids are stuck in a team for a year to memorize the Word and play games together. They develop a dynamic of cheering, who's good at what game, and even "healthly" rivalry. And it's been an opportunity for me, as a student leader, to have a way to support these kids, especially when they are not confident in a game they are playing. 

## 🙏🏾 Games as a Ministry

Harrisen, Elizabeth, and I have been meeting regularly for a few weeks now as we prepare for VBS.
