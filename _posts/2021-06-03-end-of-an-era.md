For the past seven months, I've been tutoring Renato once a week. This week, we turned each other into potatoes instead of learning English. Next week will be our last official week 😭.

I have not told him I am coming, but I did say to await a special surprise! Hope he is not disappointed that it's just me HAHA (I am bringing a gift tho just in case 😉). It has been a surprising year getting to know Renato, and I am SO thankful for the memories!

## 👨🏽‍🏫 The Kumon Life

Unlike many of my peers, I do not have the shared Kumon trauma. And I've never done legit tutoring before. And I don't know Spanish! Literally, Google Translate has been critical in ensuring comprehension when I meet with Renato. I'm also thankful for the years of serving in Awana, recalling that mindset helped me connect with Renato.

## Other updates

I can't believe I'll be in Cobán next week!!! AAHHH. A lot of prep has been happening.

### 🕺🏾 Online dance classes

Our worship team has been 110% on top of things! They've been helping us with our daily playlist at VBS and choreography. So during our Zoom prep meetings, they lead us through the songs, turning our zoom room into a dance zoom.

They've also translated songs in Spanish so we are recording our own Spanish covers of popular worship songs! SO coool! I would attach a video of myself practicing, but TBH I have not practiced enough -- I gotta get up to speed. 

### 🥁 Drums

While I was conveniently in the bay area, I picked up an electric drum set that was donated from a family related to one of the church staff in Cobán. 

The hardest thing yesterday was finding a box for this! The frame had to be disassembled so we don't get charged extra fees on our flight. 

After calling a bunch of stores, Home Depot literally had the perfect size. PTL even in the small things -- this was a great victory. I now recommend Home Depot for your cardboard box needs (Home Depot if you're reading this pls sponsor me). 

### 🎮 Games

We (Elizabeth, Harrisen, and I) have finalized the games that we'll be playing with the AMI International School and La Gracia Church kids! We are still fairly uncertain about the playing area, but we've planned to be flexible. It's definitely a challenge in prepping games since we can't practice setting due to us being remote. I am looking forward to throwing water balloons at kids haha. (In my defence I initially pitched they throw the water balloons at us HAHA. But having 80 kids destroy us with water balloons? I wouldn't want to underestimate their power.)
