For the past seven months, I've had the privilege of mentoring Renato, a first-grader in Cob치n, Guatemala. My Spanish still sucks, and my Zoom connection is similar. Despite the barriers, I've been blessed with a **growing friendship with Renato**. This friendship has helped me understand what Renato has been going through -- recently as we've been praying together, he shared about the progressive healing of one of his loved ones. From overcoming shyness to praying together, God has been working in our relationship! 

I never expected to mentor someone like Renato online before the pandemic. And since the pandemic began, I never expected that I would have the opportunity to go on missions to Guatemala. **God continues to challenge my own plans and comfort bubble**, but WOW, what a ride this has been!

This June I have the privilege to **serve for one week in Cob치n, Guatemala**, where our team will be ministering to kids from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds through Vacation Bible School. Even in preparing, there are challenges that await me -- please keep me in prayer: 

* That I continue to dedicate and prioritize time to prepare, regardless of my other commitments.  
* For my trust to be in God and not myself as I evangelize, especially in these unique circumstances.  
* To not confuse serving with my relationship with God -- may serving not become a crutch!  

I am also asking for [**donations**](https://missions.tisuela.com/support/) to support our team and myself:  
* Online @ [missions.tisuela.com/support/](https://missions.tisuela.com/support/)   
* Mail cash or checks to Church of Southland **(Attn: Nathaniel Louis Tisuela) - 1380 S. Sanderson Ave. Ste 201 Anaheim, CA 92806**  
* Venmo [@churchofsouthland](https://venmo.com/) with the memo "Nathan & Missions Support"
