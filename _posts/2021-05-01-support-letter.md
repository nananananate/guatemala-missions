For the past seven months, I've had the privilege of mentoring Renato, a first-grader in Cob치n, Guatemala. My Spanish still sucks, and my Zoom connection is similar. Despite the barriers, I've been blessed with a growing friendship with Renato. It's pretty nice to have a friend who gets my silliness and is patient with me. This friendship has helped me understand what Renato has been going through -- recently as we've been praying together, he shared about the progressive healing of one of his relatives. From overcoming shyness to praying together, God has been working in our relationship! 

This June I have the privilege to serve for one week in Cob치n, Guatemala, where our team will be ministering to kids from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds through Vacation Bible School. I'll also be able to finally hang out with Renato in person! Even in preparing, there are challenges that await me, such as learning to evangelize in a social-distanced environment.  

I never expected to mentor someone like Renato online before the pandemic. And since the pandemic began, I never expected that I would have the opportunity to go on missions to Guatemala. God continues to challenge my own plans and comfort bubble, but WOW, what a ride this has been!

You can support me by keeping Renato and the kids in Cob치n Guatemala, our missions team, and the AMI International School in your prayers.

I am also asking for monetary support for myself and our missions team, [donate with via debit or credit](https://churchofsouthland.ccbchurch.com/goto/forms/681/responses/new).
